      <h1>Amgydala Notes</h1>
      <p>Mental health care occupies a vast space in society. Emotional and psychological ailments <a href='https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/prevalence/any-mental-illness-ami-among-us-adults.shtml' target='_blank'>affect millions</a>. For those who suffer, <a href='http://time.com/4876098/new-hope-for-depression/' target='blank'>drug-based solutions</a> represent the standard method of therapy, which may prove <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/well/mind/paxil-antidepressants-suicide.html?mcubz=0' target='_blank'>more hurtful than helpful</a>, in the short- and long-term.</p>
      <p>Drug safety affects all of us, but conversations about best practices for medicine do not happen easily. Confusing and sometimes contradictory research narratives obscure the realities of the drug industry, its participants, and the drugs themselves. And yet, these conversations matter deeply.</p> 
      <p><strong>Amygdala Notes</strong> opens an inclusive dialogue about the risks of drug treatment in mental health care. This series does not condemn drug use: it is not an anti-drug campaign. Rather, this awareness-building project aims to use music as a point of entry for thinking about difficult issues in health care.</p>
