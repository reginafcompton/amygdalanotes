      <h1>Amgydala notes</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Psychiatric care occupies a complex and vast space in society. Mental health ailments affect billions. For those who suffer, drug-based solutions represent the standard method of therapy, which may prove more hurtful than helpful, in the short- and long-term.</p>
      <p>Conversations about best practices for anti-psychotic medicine do not happen easily. Byzantine and sometimes contradictory narratives obscure the realities of the drug industry, its participants, and the drugs themselves. And yet, these conversations matter deeply.</p> 
      <p>“Amygdala Notes” provides a space for contemplating the risks of drug treatment in mental health care. This series aims to build awareness about problematic prescription practices in psychiatric care by using music as a point of entry for thinking about difficult political issues.</p>
