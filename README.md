# Amygdala Notes

[Amygdala Notes](amygdalanotes.org) is a concert-and-conversation series in Chicago. It has three goals: (1) to confront established approaches to mental health care, particularly drug-based therapies, (2) to acknowledge intersections among music, emotion, and the mind, and (3) to encourage public interest in rethinking medical paradigms by using music as an access point. Each event entails a musical performance and a conversation with an expert or activist.

This repo provides the code and content for the Amygdala Notes website. It's open source! And happily, the code can be a useful blueprint for building other such simple event pages. 

## Get started

Amygdala Notes uses [Jekyll, a friendly, easy-to-use static site builder](https://jekyllrb.com/), which requires fundamental knowledge of CSS, HTML, and Liquid templates. Get started by forking the repo (via Github) and cloning your fork.

```bash
$ git clone [url to your fork]
$ cd amygdalanotes
$ gem install jekyll
$ jekyll serve -w
```

Then, navigate to http://localhost:4000/, and view the site in your browser.
