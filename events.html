      <p>Each "Amygdala notes" event comprises three parts: a performance of chamber music, a presentation, and a question-and-answer session. At an event, musicians present a selection of works that address drugs and medicine or, more broadly, acknowledge the intersection between music and mental health. Following the musical performance, a speaker offers insight into the drug industry â€“ giving emphasis to the complexities of drug-based therapies.</p>
